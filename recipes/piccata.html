    <h1>Chicken Piccata</h1>

    <img src="./images/piccata.jpg" alt="finished chicken piccata in a pan">

     <h2><strong>Chicken Piccata</strong> is an <em>Italian classic</em>. The dish is famous for
        its blend of salty capers and savory white wine sauce.</h2>

      <p>If you grew up with parents that cooked often—like we did—or grew up eating out at Italian
        restaurants basically anywhere in America (hello, Olive Garden) you’re probably kind of
        familiar with “chicken piccata” as we mean it—a pan-fried chicken cutlet, topped with a
        lemon-butter piccata sauce. BUT! Chicken piccata as we know it doesn’t actually seem to
        have origins in Italy.</p>

     <p>It’s likely an Italian-American invention, a derivative of a couple of different classic
        Italian cooking techniques, like scaloppine which means “thin slices of meat (such as veal)
        sautéed or coated with flour and fried”. A lemon and butter pan sauce is a classic way of
        dressing pan-fried meat, and is common throughout Italy, but the (brilliant) addition of
        capers can’t be attributed to any one place or time.</p>
