    <h2>My Personal Favorite: The Ribeye <em>aka</em> The Carnivor's Dream</h2>

     <p>For centuries, mankind has been craving this dish. The first
        fire by cavemen probably featured some primitive iteration.
        Now, we use advanced tactics like reverse searing, su vois, 
        etc. However, the goal remains the same: <em>to cook the meat to 
        delcious perfection.</em>
